# Face-Recognition-using-Principal-Component-Analysis

Face Recognition is one of the techniques of recognizing the given face from the known faces (data set used while training). It is diffferent from Face detection technique in which model is trained to detect whether the given image is a face of human or animal.

You can find the attached theory related to the algorithm used, the training and testing data set in zipped folders and the python code for the algorithm.

The model is trained initially. In the training session, various faces are provided (with their labels) to learn. In testing phase, the model is tested whether it can detect the given face correctly or not.

The accuracy achieved using this algorithm (PCA) varies between 52% - 60%.
